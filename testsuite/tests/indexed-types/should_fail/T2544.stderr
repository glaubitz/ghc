T2544.hs:17:12: error:
    • Couldn't match type ‘IxMap r’ with ‘IxMap i0’
      Expected type: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int]
        Actual type: BiApp (IxMap i1) (IxMap i0) [Int]
      NB: ‘IxMap’ is a type function, and may not be injective
      The type variable ‘i0’ is ambiguous
    • In the expression: BiApp empty empty
      In an equation for ‘empty’: empty = BiApp empty empty
      In the instance declaration for ‘Ix (l :|: r)’
    • Relevant bindings include
        empty :: IxMap (l :|: r) [Int] (bound at T2544.hs:17:4)
