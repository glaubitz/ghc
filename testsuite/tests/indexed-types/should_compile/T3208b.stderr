    • Could not deduce: OTerm o0 ~ STerm o0 arising from a use of ‘fce’
      from the context: (OTerm a ~ STerm a, OBJECT a, SUBST a)
        bound by the type signature for:
                   fce' :: (OTerm a ~ STerm a, OBJECT a, SUBST a) => a -> c
        at T3208b.hs:14:1-56
      The type variable ‘o0’ is ambiguous
    • In the expression: fce (apply f)
      In an equation for ‘fce'’: fce' f = fce (apply f)
